                                Fluxio Voroana is a rather interesting weapon to Fighter’s arsenal while missing s2-s3 support hurts, it’s potential almost 
                                makes it up just being 4% under Cras. This weapon really shines with S4: Radiant Response, as the extra pp you get just for 
                                dealing damage boosts it’s pp efficiency with it on.

                                To make full use of this weapon’s S1 SAF, a +200 atk affix is required as this will provide a 5% boost which is the highest amongst 
                                all SSAs a Fi would use. If you want to make Lightstream your main weapon, it’s important to note the lack of healing due to the 
                                lack of S4. I don’t recommend S2: Sturdy Recovery on LS because giving up a slot that could be used for damage makes it slightly

                            Shiho Genbu is an alright weapon (if you don’t have anything else) as Fighter/Etoile because it makes you really unkillable with Damage Balancer 
                            and Etoile Boost, while the downside about it is that its 1.08x damage is rather lackluster.

                Picking up a <strong> Helen Bathina (all class katana)</strong> is highly recommended as your overall mobility and your 
                own travel methods aren’t really great for LONG distance travels long wherever you’re going is more than 2 heartless impacts 
                away, as picking up a helen bathina and using Asagiri-rendan as it’s a faster pa and less pp than using heartless impact
                <br><br>
                Picking up something that’ll allow you to cast Shifta on yourself like <strong>Selc Flotz, Blood React (all class Jet boots 
                with access to strike gust for Shifta), or Eclucio Culte (all class Talis with access to Shifta and Deband) or Sky Dance Boon.</strong>
                Having access to Shifta yourself is a nice addition to have when all you need is just 2 ticks of Shifta or Deband to max yourself out, 
                and or just to keep a Techer’s Shifta going on you as well.
                <br><br>
                Since your mag will be pure S-ATK you would want to be feeding it any S-ATK weapons (weapons with red background for S-ATK), 
                and to balance the DEX that rise you should also feed it 4★ Furniture, and or Monomates. (Note that mates items lower less 
                DEX than Furniture.)

                And the final note as playing Fighter LB is your friend and your greatest enemy that you’ll have to conquer in order to truly 
                master, you will die a lot getting to master this class but that’s ok know your limits and slowly and surely break them, and 
                I'm sure you’ll be just fine in your time playing Fighter.

                    You start to drink the fine wine of Fighter, you know it's an acquired taste.
                    <br>
                    As you drink more, you wonder, wait, does this have vinegar in it?
                    <br>
                    You keep drinking...  just how much of this is vinegar?
                    <br>
                    You ask the vintner, and all he does is nod.
                    <br>
                    You nod back and continue drinking, and that's when you're a Fi main.
